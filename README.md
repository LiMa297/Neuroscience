This is the README and you should read it, definitely!

GroupName: Soundwave Society

IDEAS:
-increase focus- -better learning experience-
-Stress relief w/ audio support/interruption ---> concentration via ear eeg (https://doi.org/10.1109/BCI48061.2020.9061652)
-Change mental state w/ predefined music playlists ---> music therapy (DOI 10.1007/s12193-011-0080-6 and https://doi.org/10.3390/s19184014)

FURTHER DEVELOPMENT:
-recommendations based on liked songs during same mental state (https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-015-3202-4)


-details-
when mental state indicates, that learning is useless, music will play... (depending on mood) 
bandwitdth observations: increase in theta and drop in gamma ---> inattentive
                            alpha goes up ---> stress / alpha goes down ---> drowsiness
implement function in mp3 player to get songs in playlist and play automatically...

WE NEED:
-Real time EEG data
-Bandwith filters (recognize drop and increase / decicion tree) (alpha AND/OR beta)
-music player
-at least one playlist (eventually different mood playlists)
-implement decision of bandwith filter to start playlist (eventually select playlist / study break OR motivation)
-eventually timer to stop playlist (for study breaks)
